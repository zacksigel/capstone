<p class="biotext">Zack is a graduate from the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, where he studied film. After graduating, he began a career in media, 
first as an editor for a global translations company, then as a freelance music journalist covering the metal community.</p>
<p class="biotext">Now he works as the chief content strategist for M1 Finance, a tech startup that offers tools to invest, borrow, and save. 
  His experience helping to build tech products on the marketing side led to his interest in developing them on the engineering side.</p>
<p class="biotext">As a software engineer, Zack prefers to write clean, efficient code that just works. He is competent in several coding languages,
but he intends to focus on React and TypeScript as his next area of growth.</p>
<p class="biotext">In his free time, Zack writes screenplays, travels internationally, and plays PS5. He has a beginner-to-intermediate fluency in Japanese,
which he started learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. Zack is currently based out of Crown Heights, Brooklyn.</p>
